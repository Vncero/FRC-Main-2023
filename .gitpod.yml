# Currently, FRC Driver Station & other NI FRC Game Tools are not provided. There are two solutions:
#  - Use a DS alternative
#     - QDriverStation (https://github.com/FRC-Utilities/QDriverStation): 
#        - closest in appearance to actual Driver Station
#        - however, it is a known issue that it crashes shortly after starting (https://github.com/FRC-Utilities/QDriverStation/issues/70)
#     - Conductor (https://github.com/Redrield/Conductor)
#        - untested, as no prebuilt artifacts are unexpired
#     - OpenDS (https://github.com/Boomaa23/open-ds)
#        - appears extremely unlike actual Driver Station
#  - Install NI FRC Game Tools
#     - completely unimplemented (not even sure it's possible)
#       use wine, bottles, or some other way to run the installer on Ubuntu
